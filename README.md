Zen is a Computer Assisted Yoga and Pilates training system. Users are provided with immediate feedback on their posture, performance, and areas in which they can improve. This reduces the necessity of hiring a personal yoga or pilates trainer.

# Motivation

Yoga, an ancient Indian art, is gaining popularity nowadays since it not only promotes physical wellness but also helps to detoxify the body, mind, and spirit. Similarly, pilates, the modern form of yoga, is well-known for its high-calorie-burning activities. Improper postures can cause major harm to the muscles and ligaments of the body if the practitioner does not perform a pose or exercise appropriately. As a result, we are motivated to develop a computer vision-based self-training system for supporting practitioners in exercising on their own.

# Features



- **[Review](#features)** - The Review module, also known as the Dashboard, is used to visually describe the data from a pose or exercise.
- **[Learn](#features)** - The Learn module can be used to learn new poses and exercises for yoga and pilates.
- **[Practice](#features)** - The practice module can be utilised to perfect the poses and exercises that have been previously learned.
- **[Tutorials](#features)** - A curated list of tutorials.
